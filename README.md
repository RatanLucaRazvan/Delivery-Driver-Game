# Delivery-Driver-Game
Another game I created during an online course

- Here, you need to control a car using the [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT] arrows.
- Every time you will hit an obstacle, the car will slow down
- The yellow rectangle will help you get your speed back

# PURPOSE
- You need to deliver all the packages(blue squares) to the red circle
